It’s brave.",

I need help.\"\nI should be able to reach into my pocket and give -\nWithout overthinking, without calculating,\nJust… give.\n\nI never wanted billions in the bank.\nI wanted peace in my heart.\nTo be financially comfortable -\nTo eat what I crave, go where I dream,\nPay my bills on time, take care of my loved ones,\nAnd still have enough left to uplift someone who’s struggling.\n\nThat, to me, is true success.\nThat, to me, is living gracefully.\n\nNo noise. No luxury flaunted.\nJust a quiet kind of abundance -\nWhere my needs are met, my heart is full, and my hands are never empty when someone needs them.\n\nI don't want to live to impress.\nI want to live to impact - softly, but meaningfully.\n\nIf I can live a good life and help someone else breathe a little easier -\nI’ve already won.",

When you followed up, they replied:\n“Who dis?”\n– Told you they love your company, but want to see what else is out there first.\n– Sent you feedback after 3 months saying:\n“You’re doing great. Just not great enough for me.”\nAnd best of all?\n– Created a “Company Tracker Sheet” with your name in the rejected tab, just to feel something.\n\nIf candidates did all this,\nyou’d call them unprofessional, immature, unreliable.\nBut when recruiters do it?\n“It’s part of the process.”\n\nNo. It’s part of the problem.\n\nHiring shouldn’t feel like Tinder + trauma + unpaid internship all rolled into one.\nFix your process.

She earned money.\nAnd that - was the problem.\n\nHer father confessed:\n\n“Log kehte the main beti ke paiso pe jeeta hoon... unhone uski character par sawaal uthaye... usse bola academy band karo, par usne mana kar diya. Mera maan aur purush ki izzat chali gayi.”\n\nSo he waited for the right moment.\nHe sent his son to buy milk.\nThen took a gun…\nAnd shot his daughter four times.\n\nLet’s not sugarcoat this.\n\nThis was not just a murder.\nThis was a patriarch’s final act of control.\nThis was a bruised ego trying to reclaim power.\nThis was centuries of internalized misogyny pulling the trigger.\n\nA young woman’s success still brought shame to her own family.\n\nBecause she didn’t obey.\nBecause she earned.\nBecause she said no.\n\nWe do not need more coding bootcamps, fintech startups, or TED Talks until we address the mindset that sees a woman’s independence as an insult.\n\nYou can send your daughter to school, to college, abroad even -\nBut if you don’t fix the mindset that says “she’s still mine to control”,\n\nYou haven’t empowered her.\nYou’ve just educated a prisoner.\n\nTo every woman reading this:\nYou are not responsible for anyone’s ego.\nKeep shining. Keep building. Keep fighting.",
